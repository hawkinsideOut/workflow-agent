## Need Something Different?

Don't see a preset that fits your project? You have two options:

### Option 1: Custom Inline Configuration

Define scopes directly in `workflow.config.json`:

```bash
workflow init
# Select "Custom" when prompted
```

Then edit your scopes in `workflow.config.json`:

```json
{
  "projectName": "my-project",
  "scopes": [
    { "name": "custom-scope", "description": "Your custom scope" }
  ]
}
```

### Option 2: Create a Custom Scope Package (Recommended)

Build a reusable scope package for your domain:

```bash
workflow scope:create
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Reuse across multiple projects
- ✅ Share with your team/organization
- ✅ Version control and publishing to npm
- ✅ Automatic validation and testing
- ✅ Domain-specific naming (fintech, healthcare, gaming, etc.)

**Example domains:**
- **FinTech:** accounts, transactions, payments, compliance, kyc
- **Healthcare:** patients, appointments, prescriptions, lab-results
- **Gaming:** players, matches, inventory, leaderboards, guilds
- **Education:** courses, students, assignments, grading, enrollment

### Migrating Existing Scopes

Already have inline scopes? Convert them to a reusable package:

```bash
workflow scope:migrate
```

This extracts your scopes from `workflow.config.json` into a standalone package.
