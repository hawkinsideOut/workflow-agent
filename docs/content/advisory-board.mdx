# Advisory Board Analysis

The Advisory Board Analysis feature provides comprehensive audits of your application, simulating the strategic questions and insights that would be presented to an executive advisory board. It analyzes technologies, packages, platforms, and business alignment to help stakeholders make informed decisions.

## Overview

This feature performs a deep analysis of your codebase to:

- **Identify technologies, packages, and platforms** in use across your application
- **Assess business value** and how each technology meets organizational needs
- **Generate strategic questions** that an advisory board would ask
- **Track changes over time** with quarterly comparison reports
- **Provide risk assessments** for technical debt and security concerns
- **Recommend growth opportunities** for optimization and modernization

## Depth Levels

The analyzer offers four depth levels to suit different audiences and use cases:

| Depth Level | Audience | Analysis Time | Focus |
|------------|----------|---------------|-------|
| **Executive** | Non-technical stakeholders, C-suite | < 30s | High-level business metrics, ROI, strategic recommendations |
| **Quick** | Managers, team leads | ~1 min | Technology overview, package summary, key risks |
| **Standard** | Engineers, architects | ~2-3 min | Detailed package analysis, architecture patterns, technical debt |
| **Comprehensive** | Deep audits, compliance reviews | ~5-10 min | Full codebase analysis, security audits, dependency graphs, code quality metrics |

## CLI Usage

### Basic Command

```bash
# Generate a standard analysis report
pnpm workflow advisory

# Or with npx
npx workflow-agent advisory
```

### Command Options

1. Analysis depth level
2. Output directory
3. Whether to include health metrics
4. Output format preference

#### Quarterly Comparison

```bash
# Compare Q3 vs Q4 reports to track progress
pnpm workflow advisory --compare docs/advisory/analysis-2024-q3.json --timestamp
```

**Output:** `comparison-report-YYYY-MM-DD.md` showing:
- New risks introduced
- Resolved risks since last report
- Risk score changes (trending up/down)
- New opportunities identified
- Package additions/removals/updates
- Technology stack changes

#### CI/CD Integration

```bash
# Run in CI with quality gates
pnpm workflow advisory --ci --depth quick

# Exit codes:
# 0 = Success (no critical risks)
# 1 = Critical risks detected (>= 0.8 severity)
# 2 = High risks detected (>= 0.6 severity)
```

Use in GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or other pipelines to enforce quality thresholds.

## Best Practices

### Quarterly Reviews

Run comprehensive analyses quarterly to track:
- Technology stack evolution
- Risk trend analysis (improving vs degrading)
- Opportunity realization (what was implemented)
- Package update hygiene

```bash
# Q4 2024 analysis
pnpm workflow advisory --depth comprehensive --timestamp --format both

# Q1 2025 comparison
pnpm workflow advisory --compare docs/advisory/analysis-2024-12-14.json --timestamp
```

### Pre-Board Meetings

Generate executive summaries 1-2 days before advisory board meetings:

```bash
pnpm workflow advisory --depth executive --output board-materials/2024-q4
```

Distribute `executive-summary.md` and `board-questions.md` to board members in advance.

### CI/CD Quality Gates

Add to your deployment pipeline:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy.yml
jobs:
  quality-check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Install deps
        run: pnpm install
      - name: Advisory Analysis
        run: pnpm workflow advisory --ci --depth quick
```

Block deployments if critical risks are detected.

### Health Integration

Combine with improvement tracker for holistic quality metrics:

```bash
# Generate health report first
pnpm workflow improvement-tracker analyze

# Include health scores in advisory
pnpm workflow advisory --include-health
```

This correlates technical decisions with codebase health trends.

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Risk Thresholds

Override default thresholds for specific compliance requirements:

```json
{
  "advisory": {
    "riskThresholds": {
      "critical": 0.9,    // Only P0 security issues
      "high": 0.7,        // P1 + major tech debt
      "medium": 0.5       // P2 + minor issues
    }
  }
}
```

### Filtered Analysis

Analyze specific package categories:

```json
{
  "advisory": {
    "categories": [
      "Authentication",
      "Database ORM",
      "API/Data Fetching"
    ]
  }
}
```

This focuses the analysis on security-critical or data-handling packages.

### Exclude Irrelevant Code

Skip generated files and vendor code:

```json
{
  "advisory": {
    "excludePatterns": [
      "**/node_modules/**",
      "**/dist/**",
      "**/build/**",
      "**/.next/**",
      "**/vendor/**",
      "**/__generated__/**"
    ]
  }
}
```

### JSON-Only Output

For programmatic processing:

```bash
pnpm workflow advisory --format json --output data/advisory.json
```

Parse with `jq`, Python scripts, or dashboard tools.

## Troubleshooting

### "No package.json found"

**Cause:** Analyzer cannot locate `package.json` in current directory or parent directories.

**Solution:** Run from project root or specify path:
```bash
cd /path/to/project-root
pnpm workflow advisory
```

### High Analysis Time (>10 minutes)

**Cause:** Very large monorepo with 100+ packages.

**Solution:** Use `quick` depth or add exclusion patterns:
```bash
pnpm workflow advisory --depth quick
```

Or exclude large directories:
```json
{
  "advisory": {
    "excludePatterns": [
      "**/node_modules/**",
      "**/test-fixtures/**",
      "**/examples/**"
    ]
  }
}
```

### Missing Health Metrics

**Cause:** Improvement tracker not configured or no analysis run yet.

**Solution:** Run improvement tracker first:
```bash
pnpm workflow improvement-tracker analyze
pnpm workflow advisory --include-health
```

### CI Mode Not Failing

**Cause:** No risks exceed configured thresholds.

**Solution:** Check risk scores in `analysis.json`:
```bash
jq '.risks[] | select(.severity >= 0.8)' docs/advisory/analysis.json
```

If no critical risks exist, CI passes with exit code 0.

### Comparison Report Empty

**Cause:** Comparing identical analyses or incorrect path to baseline report.

**Solution:** Verify baseline path and ensure it's from a different time period:
```bash
ls -la docs/advisory/analysis-*.json
pnpm workflow advisory --compare docs/advisory/analysis-2024-10-01.json
```

## FAQ

**Q: How often should we run advisory analysis?**

A: Quarterly for standard projects, monthly for high-velocity teams, weekly for compliance-critical applications.

**Q: Can I customize the question categories?**

A: Yes, add custom questions to `workflow.config.json` under `advisory.customQuestions`. They'll be merged with built-in categories.

**Q: What's the difference between `quick` and `executive` depth?**

A: `quick` provides technical overview for engineers, `executive` is non-technical business summary for leadership.

**Q: How do risk scores get calculated?**

A: Scores (0.0-1.0) combine factors like package age, security vulnerabilities, large dependency counts, outdated versions, and usage patterns.

**Q: Can I run this on private/monorepo projects?**

A: Yes, the analyzer detects monorepos automatically and analyzes all workspace packages. Use `excludePatterns` to skip private packages if needed.

**Q: Does this send data to external services?**

A: No, all analysis is local. No data leaves your machine unless you commit reports to git or integrate with external tools.

**Q: Can I use this for compliance audits (SOC2, ISO)?**

A: Yes, `comprehensive` depth provides detailed dependency audits, security scanning, and documentation suitable for compliance reviews.

   pnpm workflow advisory --interactive
   ```

2. **Configure custom questions** in `workflow.config.json`

3. **Set up GitHub Actions workflow** for automated quarterly reports

4. **Schedule board meeting** and distribute executive summary

5. **Track progress** by running comparison reports each quarter
