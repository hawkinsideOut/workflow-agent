# Getting Started

Workflow Agent is a self-evolving workflow management system that helps teams maintain consistent development practices.

## Installation

### CLI

#### Global Installation

Install the CLI globally to use `workflow-agent` from anywhere:

```bash
# npm
npm install -g @hawkinside_out/workflow-agent --ignore-scripts

# pnpm
pnpm add -g @hawkinside_out/workflow-agent --ignore-scripts
```

#### Local Installation (Per-Project)

Install as a dev dependency in your project:

```bash
# npm
npm install -D @hawkinside_out/workflow-agent --ignore-scripts

# pnpm
pnpm add -D @hawkinside_out/workflow-agent --ignore-scripts
```

When installed locally, use it via:

```bash
# Run directly with pnpm
pnpm workflow-agent init

# Or via npx
npx workflow-agent init

# Or add to package.json scripts:
# "scripts": {
#   "workflow:init": "workflow-agent init",
#   "workflow:validate": "workflow-agent validate",
#   "workflow:doctor": "workflow-agent doctor"
# }
pnpm run workflow:init
```

### VS Code Extension

1. Open VS Code
2. Go to Extensions (Ctrl+Shift+X)
3. Search for "Workflow Agent"
4. Click Install

## Quick Start

### 1. Initialize Your Project

Navigate to your project directory and run:

```bash
# If installed globally:
workflow-agent init

# If installed locally:
pnpm workflow-agent init
# or
npx workflow-agent init
```

This will:
- Detect your project type (SaaS, Library, API, etc.)
- Generate appropriate scopes
- Create `workflow.config.json`
- Set up guidelines in `.github/`

### 2. Choose a Preset

Select from pre-configured presets:

- **SaaS Application** - For web applications with frontend and backend
- **Library** - For npm packages and libraries
- **API Service** - For REST/GraphQL APIs
- **E-commerce** - For online stores
- **CMS** - For content management systems

Or create a custom configuration.

### 3. Start Using

Workflow Agent will now:
- ✅ Validate commit messages
- ✅ Enforce branch naming conventions
- ✅ Suggest scope improvements
- ✅ Generate development guidelines

## Non-Interactive Mode

For CI/CD or scripting, use flags:

```bash
workflow init --preset library --name my-package --yes
```
