# Getting Started

Workflow Agent is a self-evolving workflow management system that helps teams maintain consistent development practices.

## Installation

### CLI

#### Global Installation

Install the CLI globally to use `workflow-agent` from anywhere:

```bash
# npm
npm install -g @hawkinside_out/workflow-agent --ignore-scripts

# pnpm
pnpm add -g @hawkinside_out/workflow-agent --ignore-scripts
```

#### Local Installation (Per-Project)

Install as a dev dependency in your project:

```bash
# npm
npm install -D @hawkinside_out/workflow-agent

# pnpm
pnpm add -D @hawkinside_out/workflow-agent
```

> ⚠️ **pnpm users:** pnpm blocks postinstall scripts by default. After installation, run the setup command to add workflow scripts to your package.json:
>
> ```bash
> pnpm workflow-agent setup
> ```

On install (npm/yarn) or after running setup (pnpm), **38 workflow scripts** are automatically added to your `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    // Core Commands
    "workflow:init": "workflow-agent init",
    "workflow:validate": "workflow-agent validate",
    "workflow:config": "workflow-agent config",
    "workflow:suggest": "workflow-agent suggest",
    "workflow:setup": "workflow-agent setup",
    "workflow:doctor": "workflow-agent doctor",

    // Scope Commands
    "workflow:scope:create": "workflow-agent scope:create",
    "workflow:scope:migrate": "workflow-agent scope:migrate",

    // Verification
    "workflow:verify": "workflow-agent verify",
    "workflow:verify:fix": "workflow-agent verify --fix",
    "workflow:auto-setup": "workflow-agent auto-setup",

    // Learning System
    "workflow:learn": "workflow-agent learn:list",
    "workflow:learn:record": "workflow-agent learn:record",
    "workflow:learn:list": "workflow-agent learn:list",
    "workflow:learn:apply": "workflow-agent learn:apply",
    "workflow:learn:publish": "workflow-agent learn:publish",
    "workflow:learn:sync": "workflow-agent learn:sync",
    "workflow:learn:config": "workflow-agent learn:config",
    "workflow:learn:deprecate": "workflow-agent learn:deprecate",
    "workflow:learn:stats": "workflow-agent learn:stats",

    // Solution Patterns
    "workflow:solution": "workflow-agent solution:list",
    "workflow:solution:capture": "workflow-agent solution:capture",
    "workflow:solution:search": "workflow-agent solution:search",
    "workflow:solution:list": "workflow-agent solution:list",
    "workflow:solution:apply": "workflow-agent solution:apply",
    "workflow:solution:deprecate": "workflow-agent solution:deprecate",
    "workflow:solution:stats": "workflow-agent solution:stats",

    // Advisory Board
    "workflow:advisory": "workflow-agent advisory",
    "workflow:advisory:quick": "workflow-agent advisory --depth quick",
    "workflow:advisory:standard": "workflow-agent advisory --depth standard",
    "workflow:advisory:comprehensive": "workflow-agent advisory --depth comprehensive",
    "workflow:advisory:executive": "workflow-agent advisory --depth executive",
    "workflow:advisory:ci": "workflow-agent advisory --ci"
  }
}
```

**Note:** When you update the package, any new scripts from newer versions are automatically added.

Run commands via:

```bash
# Run directly with pnpm
pnpm workflow-agent init

# Or via npx
npx workflow-agent init

# Or add to package.json scripts:
# "scripts": {
#   "workflow:init": "workflow-agent init",
#   "workflow:validate": "workflow-agent validate",
#   "workflow:doctor": "workflow-agent doctor"
# }
pnpm run workflow:init
```

### VS Code Extension

1. Open VS Code
2. Go to Extensions (Ctrl+Shift+X)
3. Search for "Workflow Agent"
4. Click Install

## Quick Start

### 1. Initialize Your Project

Navigate to your project directory and run:

```bash
# If installed globally:
workflow-agent init

# If installed locally:
pnpm workflow-agent init
# or
npx workflow-agent init
```

This will:
- Detect your project type (SaaS, Library, API, etc.)
- Generate appropriate scopes
- Create `workflow.config.json`
- Set up guidelines in `.github/`

### 2. Choose a Preset

Select from pre-configured presets:

- **SaaS Application** - For web applications with frontend and backend
- **Library** - For npm packages and libraries
- **API Service** - For REST/GraphQL APIs
- **E-commerce** - For online stores
- **CMS** - For content management systems

Or create a custom configuration.

### 3. Start Using

Workflow Agent will now:
- ✅ Validate commit messages
- ✅ Enforce branch naming conventions
- ✅ Suggest scope improvements
- ✅ Generate development guidelines

## Non-Interactive Mode

For CI/CD or scripting, use flags:

```bash
workflow init --preset library --name my-package --yes
```
