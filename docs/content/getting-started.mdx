# Getting Started

Workflow Agent is a self-evolving workflow management system that helps teams maintain consistent development practices.

## Installation

### CLI

Install the CLI globally using npm or pnpm:

```bash
npm install -g @workflow/agent
# or
pnpm add -g @workflow/agent
```

### VS Code Extension

1. Open VS Code
2. Go to Extensions (Ctrl+Shift+X)
3. Search for "Workflow Agent"
4. Click Install

## Quick Start

### 1. Initialize Your Project

Navigate to your project directory and run:

```bash
workflow init
```

This will:
- Detect your project type (SaaS, Library, API, etc.)
- Generate appropriate scopes
- Create `workflow.config.json`
- Set up guidelines in `.github/`

### 2. Choose a Preset

Select from pre-configured presets:

- **SaaS Application** - For web applications with frontend and backend
- **Library** - For npm packages and libraries
- **API Service** - For REST/GraphQL APIs
- **E-commerce** - For online stores
- **CMS** - For content management systems

Or create a custom configuration.

### 3. Start Using

Workflow Agent will now:
- ✅ Validate commit messages
- ✅ Enforce branch naming conventions
- ✅ Suggest scope improvements
- ✅ Generate development guidelines

## Non-Interactive Mode

For CI/CD or scripting, use flags:

```bash
workflow init --preset library --name my-package --yes
```
